Habitual
=========

Habitual is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows for customers to order items from the menu and for restaurants to manage orders. **BEWARE**: This app was published for learning purposes and it is not intended for use in production-grade software without a proper code review.

This project was created and published by me, [shuchitama](https://github.com/shuchitama) and [Joe123123](https://github.com/Joe123123) as part of our learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Final Product

- Customers can add and remove products from the cart, and modify quantities in the cart
- Restaurants can see all orders divided by their status (pending, accepted, completed, cancelled)
- Restaurants are notified by an audio & in-browser notification about new orders
- Customers are informed about their order status through visual, auduio, and SMS notifications
