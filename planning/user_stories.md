1. As a customer, I want to  be able to view the menu because I want to see the selection with pictures and price.
2. As a customer, I want to be able to add and remove items from my shopping cart & to see the order total.
3. As a customer, I want to be able to place my order and know it is placed.
4. As a customer, I want to be able to receive notifications from the app because I want to know when my order is accepted and when it is ready.
5. As a restaurant, I want to see incoming &  past orders because I want to know what do I need to cook.
6. As a restaurant, I want to be able to update order status because I want the customer to know whether the order was accepted or not, or how long the wait would be (pickup ETA) and it should be done by SMS.
7. As a restaurant, I want to be visually & audibly notified about a new incoming order because I don't want miss any orders and I don't want to keep my customers waiting.
