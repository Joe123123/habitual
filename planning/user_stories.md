1. As a customer, I want to  be able to view the menu because I want to see the selection with pictures and price.

- Given that I am a hungry cutomer, when I open the website of your restaurant, I want to see a list of foods with name, picture, price, description, and an 'Add to order' button.

2. As a customer, I want to be able to add and remove items from my shopping cart & to see the order total.

- When I add an item to the cart (when I click "Add to order" button), I want to see the item appear in the cart, along with an updated total, and a "Place Order" button. I also want to be able to update the quantity of each item, and see updated order total after the changes are done. I also want to have a "Delete from order" button (X) that will remove the current item from the cart and update order total.

3. As a customer, I want to be able to place my order and know it is placed.

- Given that I have added the items that I want into my "shopping cart" I want to be able to click "Place Order" button, which will send my order to the restaurant. I want to see a notification from the app that the order has been placed.

4. As a customer, I want to be able to receive notifications from the app because I want to know when my order is accepted and when it is ready.

- Considering that I placed an order, I would like to receive a SMS and app notification from the restaurant when the order has been accepted (or cancelled) and how long the wait is going to be. I would also like to be informed when the order has been completed (by SMS & app).

5. As a restaurant, I want to see incoming & past orders because I want to know what do I need to cook.

-  I  want to have a page that will display the order details, and will separate current (pending/accepted) orders from past (completed/cancelled) orders.

6. As a restaurant, I want to be able to update order status because I want the customer to know whether the order was accepted or not, or how long the wait would be (pickup ETA) and it should be done by SMS.

- When I see a pending order, I would like to see a button that will allow me to change the order status to 1) cancelled or 2) accepted. If I select "Cancel Order" it should be removed from the "Current Order" List and move to "Completed Order". If I select "Accept Order" I will be presented with a text field to enter the estimated prep time. The customer will be notified in either case by SMS & app.

7. As a restaurant, I want to be visually & audibly notified about a new incoming order because I don't want miss any orders and I don't want to keep my customers waiting.

- When a new order is placed, I should be receiving an SMS message, along with a non-disruptive visual notification in the app, as well as the order should appear highlighted in the order list. In addition, the app should provide an alert sound when the new order arrives.
